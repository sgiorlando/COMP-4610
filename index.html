    File Description: This file is a simple webpage that
    serves as an introducton of myself.  It has been enhanced with
    various styles of css that I have learned so far.  When you click on each
    assignment it should redirect the user to a page with the assignment I've done
    or the page will have a title of "Work In Progress" and have some prompt like a 404
    error page.

    This file did pass both validators that were given in
    the assignment specification.

        <h4>About Me:</h4>
        <p>
          Hi!  My name is Scott Giorlando! <br>
          I am a 22 year old senior currently enrolled in the Computer Science program at UMass Lowell.
          This semester <strong>(Fall 2019)</strong> is supposed to be my last semester in my Bachelor's program.
          I intend on graduating with a Bachelor's in Science for Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm glad I was able to catch GUI 1 in my time at UMass, because I am interested in web development.
          I have never done anything involving coding in HTML.
          However, I previously worked in the IT department at a company called <strong>Massachusetts Health and Hospital Association</strong> (MHA)
          and I helped a fellow colleague make changes to MHA's websites by inspecting the sources and finding errors.
          So I have seen a few things in HTML and CSS before, but I've never actually done anything myself.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- I changed my sections into divs, and labeled this one "hobbiesandskills".  The content about me has not changed too much. -->
    <div id="hobbiesandskills">
        <h4>Hobbies and Skills:</h4>
        <p>
          Outside of class I usually like to play Video Games or watch some movies or TV shows.
          That is not all I do outside of school though.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also know how to play Viola.
          A Viola is <em>a lower toned Violin</em>, so essentially it's more bassy which means it has lower pitched sounds than a regular Violin can reach,
          but it has a higher pitch than a Cello or Bass.  I have known how to play a Viola since 4<sup>th</sup> grade,
          but I haven't really played it regularly since Freshmen year of highschool.
          I have tried picking it up again a few times but I'm not nearly as good as I used to be.  I personally feel like broadening my horizon of instruments
          at some point in the future.  I intend on learning how to play guitar as my next instrument.
        </p>

        <!-- I also made a div for each image I included, and I changed the image of the string family to one of a Viola specifically !-->
        <div id="stringfamilyimage">
            <img src="images/viola.jpg" alt="Image showing the viola">
        </div>

        <p>
          Another skill from my past is that I know how to assemble and solder different circuits.
          I know how to do this because I did not attend a regular highschool, I actually went to a Vocational highschool in Billerica MA.
          It is called <strong>Shawsheen Valley Regional Vocational Technical Highschool</strong>.
          Everyone calls it <strong>Shawsheen Tech</strong> for short.  A Vocational School is a trade school so most people do not attend a college when they graduate.
          The trade I chose to do at the Tech was known as <strong>Electronics</strong> which is equivalent to basic <strong>Engineering</strong>.
          I enjoyed what I did in highschool, and I wanted to originally pursue Computer Engineering as a career.
          When I graduated I had realized that I was more interested in software versus hardware and Computer Engineering is more hardware than it is software.
          That is how I ended up in Computer Science, but I do not regret learning what I did in highschool.
